# Life Alive

*VERSE*  
Blue and green and yellow streams of water  
Under the light of huge trees  
Standing at the place where they were meant to be  

*CHORUS*  
Well its called  
Life Alive  
Under the plomp sky  
Life is so alive  
Plomp sky!  

Hey, this bird wants to fly to touch the sky  
At least this bird, is alive  

*VERSE*  
Fine and warm and purple, views of nature,  
Watched through glasses I brought here,  
So maybe I can absorb a little more of this  
  
When You got closer and closer near my glass lens  
I was just hoping I could see  
the rainbows of feelings you didn't have for me  


*CHORUS*  
At least,  
I will be able to say I  
Lived alive!  
Under the plomp sky  
Life is so alive  
Plomp sky!  
  
  
# Bike  
  
*VERSE*  
Friends persuading me to text the girl I like  
Dont know what to type, oh this doesn't feel too right (butterflies!)  
But then they grab my phone,  
and send a weird thing straight away  
  
*CHORUS*  
Taking a ride on my bike the Wind blows right into my mouth  
It's quite a blessing not having a destination  
Passing through the town watching all the life around  
And I quite like it sure I like it  
  
*VERSE*  
Hello friend can I come to your place  
just to see your face I'll be there fast if you say: "Yes you can!"  
On my way with excitement  
Going to see your velvet hair  
  
*VERSE*  
Hours go by enjoying the evenings  
Red clouds on the sky oh I don't have a control of time  
But please don't look into the past  
Tomorrow will be there fast  
  
  
# Mac Demarco  
  
He was there with all kinds of people  
Having different views and varied minds  
Creating the order of good and bad  
While having doubts about cats and dogs  
  
They forgot how to call my phone  
So they write so many texts about being alone  
And it's understandable In the city of people  
Under layers of concrete living can be hard  
  
Extinction in the light of our phones  
Mary when you'll understand? We must stop doing what we do  
Children in the zoo, hidden suffering  
Johny's conglomerate seized the river  
  
Why can we control the game table  
When did mother lose control  
Why she let us thrive with greed  
When everything is falling apart  
  
  
# Brazil  
  
*VERSE*  
I don't have the urge to find it (urge to find)  
I don't mind  
I fell down to get straight again (straight again)  
I am so lined  
Know too much to still ignore it (still ignore)  
Might be fine  
Why did I Smell the Lavender (why i smell it)  
Just by a chance  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
Just a chance is that I met you  
Is is worth the Abby's of time  
  
*CHORUS*  
Burn it down  
Fireproof west  
What wil you say when will you pray  
When you see the light  
  
*VERSE*  
Filling gaps of my life with memories  
I need to with empty space for you  
Time crisis coming I feel  
to keep going im not sure  
Is this the dopamine I seek in u  
Serotonin of my brain  
Deep down inside of me myself  
Control and Lie will melt  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
Living life without any Control  
Is the last thing I want  
  
*BREAKDOWN*  
it should be finally all right  
savin it all right tíl the end  
im falling down into your arms  
falling down  
fall and fell  
  
# Normal song  
  
*VERSE*  
Drowned in the lights  
And im hoping this time it will  
Come around  
Not for anyone  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
I thought it would always come  
All I did write 2 lines with a thumb  
Say at loud the sound is not so dumb  
  
*CHORUS*  
Believe in the universe of the world!  
And take everything as granted once for all  
City lights are just like the  
End of a tunnel  
  
*VERSE*  
Swimming with the sun  
And I'm racing with the clouds  
On the sky  
Till the sun rays melt my heart  
  
# Florian  
  
*VERSE*  
Last days of particulary long 2 year holiday  
And asking how did i end up here  
Ahen all my friends are in a labor  
In a 4 bedded room at least someone is with me  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
Is this what you wanted  
Loneliness is a joy only shared  
I´d take alone but not plain  
  
*VERSE*  
How did I end up in a house of noise  
Danish new wave scene so raw  
In a church cemetery right after the show  
Everyone so open not like anything  
I know  
  
  
*BREAK*  
Everyone evacuate immidiately  
Pack your 20 luxury golf poles  
All worried now whats happening  
why at 2 am 2 days in a row sirens howling?!  
  
*BREAKDOWN*  
I already hear the shells dropping on my grave  
And the flame is telling stories caught in the air  
It's not again i swear but i got away  
  
*OUTRO*  
I went down to the mirror where we met  
  
  
# Superzoom  
  
Zoom in to see the lamp  
In front of my house  
Way back from deep space  
With 2 million megapixels  
  
If I could fly away  
With a button to press in my hand  
To get back to the normal days  
Just in case  
  
Lots of windows open  
All the lights at once  
Hope that she's okay  
In the dead of night  
  
Hope that she's okay  
In the dead of night  
Zoom in  
Zoom in  
  
Zoom in (Hey!)  
  
# So stoned  
  
*VERSE*  
Everything is grey and  
Everything is gray  
And nothing is black or white  
  
Time is running out and  
The time time is running out  
So when will you decide  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
I'm scared  
That you will leave us  
  
*CHORUS*  
So stoned  
Asking your shoes where you belong  
If you decide to go  
  
So stoned  
Asking your shoes where you belong  
If you decide to go  
  
*VERSE*  
Careless road is under construction  
I see you in in it's reflection  
  
1 am in night and  
The bakery still runs  
So what will you sacrifice  
  
*PRECHORUS*  
I'm scared  
That you will leave us  
  
*CHORUS*  
So stoned  
Asking your shoes where you belong  
If you decide to go to  
A different place than where we are now  
  
So stoned  
Asking your shoes where you belong  
If you decide to go  
A different place than where we are now
